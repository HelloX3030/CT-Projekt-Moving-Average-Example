This is a school project of mine, where I tried to create a little trading bot using python and the alpaca trading api. 

## Getting started

- Import all needet python liberies from "requirements.txt"
- set up your alpaca keys in keys.json
- set up you blankly model-id, project-id, api_key, and api_pass
- add the "blankly_comfort_functions" folder to your python interpreter and set up your api keys in it
